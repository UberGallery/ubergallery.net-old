<h2>The Simple PHP Photo Gallery</h2>
<p>UberGallery is a simple, yet powerful, PHP photo gallery that
will basically manage itself for you. UberGallery supports .jpg, .gif
and .png image types, and will automatically creates thumbnails on the
fly. The main feature of this gallery is it automatically outputs XHTML
compliant markup for inclusion on a web page. The UberGallery will also
automatically prune it's thumbnails, so when you delete an image from
the images folder, it will delete the corresponding thumbnail. The
gallery also creates a log file for reference and debugging. The
UberGallery is licensed under the MIT License.</p>

<p>UberGallery also includes dynamic pagination. This allows users
with larger galleries to split the gallery up into several smaller pages
so visitors can easily browse those pages using a navigation bar below
the gallery. GZip compression is also implemented on the default
index.php file included with the gallery which helps to reduce bandwidth
usage and improves page load times significantly.</p>

<p>Starting with v1.6.3 UberGallery is dual licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/MIT/">MIT license</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/">GPL 2.0 license</a>.</p>
